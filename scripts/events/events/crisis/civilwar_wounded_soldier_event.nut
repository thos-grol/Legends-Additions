He\'s on the ground, leaning against a rock wall, one arm draped over the top of it as if he\'d just placed the last stone. Looking up at you, he sneers.%SPEECH_ON%Whatcha want, mercenary? You come to finish me off, huh? Take all I got and more?%SPEECH_OFF%He\'s wearing a nice set of armor and has a weapon on him. Not that he\'ll be defending himself with it in his current state, but it\'d look good in the hands of one of your men. %randombrother% walks up.%SPEECH_ON%We can take him, sir, but we should make it quick. Who knows who could catch us for he wears the cloth of a nobleman\'s army.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come across a wounded soldier of %noblehouse%, your allies. Lying in the grass, he postures up to get a good look at you and you get a good look at him in return: the man is adorned with a decent armor piece and he\'s got a weapon balanced across his legs. You could take both, but the man does not seem willing to peacefully part with either. And there\'s a good chance the rest of the soldier\'s army is not far off... | A wounded soldier of %noblehouse%, your allies, lays in the path. He\'s dragging himself away, but upon hearing you he stops and turns around.%SPEECH_ON%Ah hell. You\'d best turn \'round, mercenary. My men are not far yonder and if you come after me I\'ll scream.%SPEECH_OFF%You raise an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%You\'ll go out like a woman, eh?%SPEECH_OFF%The man spits.%SPEECH_ON%I\'ll go out knowing I won\'t have to wait long to meet ya again in the next world.%SPEECH_OFF%The snarky git has a nice set of armor and weapons on him, but %randombrother% does warn he is a member of a nobleman\'s army. | A wounded soldier of %noblehouse%\'s army lies before you. On one hand, he does have a weapon and some armor you could take from him. On the other hand, he is no doubt party to a much, much larger force than yours. It just happens to not be watching at this very moment. If you decide to take his things, be sure to be quick about it. | Luck or impending disaster? You\'ve found a wounded soldier dressed in reasonably nice looking armor. He\'s also got a weapon by his side that\'d look even better by the side of one of the %companyname%\'s men. Taking his things would be a cinch. No one\'s around to see and muffling him wouldn\'t be that hard.\n\nThen again, if someone were to see it\'d most likely be someone party to a very, very large army because this soldier happens to wear the cloth of %noblehouse%, your ally. Decisions, decisions... | You come across a wounded soldier wearing a shredded banner of %noblehouse%, your ally. Seeing you, he quickly scoots backward across the grass. He throws his hand out and tries to curse, but only blood spits from his mouth. %randombrother% walks up to you.%SPEECH_ON%Sir, he\'s got a nice set of armor and a weapon on him. We could take him out, if you want, but there is a risk that his army is not far off. We should be very careful about this.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find a soldier of %noblehouse% trying to kick in the door of an abandoned hovel. Hearing you, he quickly wheels around, lifting a sword up to defend himself. The blade, however, wobbles in an unsteady grip. Blood runs the length of his arm, dripping off at the wrist, and the man is struggling to stand.%SPEECH_ON%Stay back, the lot of you!%SPEECH_OFF%A fearful man backed into a corner. How unfortunate he isn\'t an animal, lest you\'d think twice about...\n\n %randombrother% grabs you by the arm.%SPEECH_ON%Hold on, sir. If the rest of his army spots us we are going to be in some real trouble. Let\'s try and think this out, yeah?%SPEECH_OFF%}",
