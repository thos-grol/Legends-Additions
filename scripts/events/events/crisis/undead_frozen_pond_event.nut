Icicles dangle off its sword, the blade itself encapsulated in a layer of ice. The sellsword grabs the blade and yanks. The undead knight\'s arm lurches forward and breaks off at the elbow, sending the sellsword arse-skating backward across the pond. He slides up against the edge where your men help him up.
