Greenskins overran the defenses and killed everyone they got their hands on.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come across a trader on the path. His cart is emptied and missing some draught animals. There\'s blood on his face and clothes. You ask the man for his story. He straightens up.%SPEECH_ON%My story? No, it ain\'t my story. I was on my way to %city% only to find it overrun by greenskins.
