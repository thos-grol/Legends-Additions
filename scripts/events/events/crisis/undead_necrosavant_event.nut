Violence was the answer they found - and so they decided to dismantle it stone by stone. I\'d admonish them for that, but it\'d be a ruse. I\'d probably do the same as they did had I the means, but, you know, I\'m old as shite and can\'t do much beyond lifting my own fingers.

Monks used to splash water in it to cleanse the sick. It ain\'t the answer I was looking for, but here, take it. I\'ve no use for such things. Not now. Not in any sense.
