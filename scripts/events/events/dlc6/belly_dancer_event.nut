She whirls, hips hypnotic, elbows bowed, hands clapping little cymbals, her feet tiptoeing as she spins a spot so tight there very well may be an invisible god above holding her in place as she razzles and dazzles.\n\n Someone throws an apple through the air and the dancer spins around and shoots a tiny dagger through it, plugging it dead center and dropping the fruit to the ground. Another apple soars in and this time a large saber is produced and slashes the stem off and she catches the rest and takes a bite. The crowd claps gently to this.}",
