Another comes at you only to be cut to pieces by the rest of the company who jump to your side.\n\n In the distance a group of merchants are standing on their wagons, firing crossbow bolts into the groups of swarming wildmen while what remains of the caravan guards attempt to claw some space back from the screaming throng.

The cart has several sealed crates and lockboxes, of which the company is only able to take a few of before attracting attention from the wildmen again.\n\n A few wildmen begin to make noise in your direction as %companyname% backs up slowly while hauling the lighter chests away with whatever free hands they have.
