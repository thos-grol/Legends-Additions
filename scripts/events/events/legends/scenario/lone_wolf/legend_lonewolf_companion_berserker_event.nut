The settlement is somewhere between a crude camp and an established home where the occasional tent or ramshackle struture breaks up the more uniform and thoughtful huts.\n In the distance, you can hear fighting, and more alarmingly, screaming.}",

Two-dozen bodies burn on the the pyre in the middle of the area, some melted away while others have been added more recently.\n\n You follow the screaming to find a lone fighter — a barely dressed and heavily bleeding mountain of a northman who is in the process of ripping a necrosavant\'s head in two by parting its upper and lower jaw away with their bare hands like a scribe would part a large tome with a stiff spine. You cannot tell if the screaming is from the berserker or the bloodsucker which is now clawing for freedom to no avail.\n A crack is heard and the vampire falls to the ground with its lower jaw loling free. It hits the snow the pale skin turns to ash like a book soaked in heavy rain. Two more of it\'s kind emerge from a longhouse, as you draw your weapon with a hurried breath they both disappear back into the storm.\n\n Of the two of you, the berserker is the first to speak. %SPEECH_ON%My name is %dude%, and what you see around me is the last of my people...%SPEECH_OFF% You cast a gaze around, anticipaing more will emerge from the huts.
