One step sank your foot deep into the white powder and it was then you knew the rest of the journey would be a test of endurance.\n\nYou wonder how the men of old did it, living in these parts. They sat around campfires with all the world out to get them. Sat in the darkness surrounded by flurries of ice. Sat in isolation. They were born here, that must have been their trick. Ignorance was their warmth. Only a man who knows no better could live in a place such as this.\n\nThe men of the %companyname% stagger and fall and don\'t get back up with quite the speed they used to.
