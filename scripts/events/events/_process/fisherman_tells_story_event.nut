Fish so big that when I yanked it from the waters the whole river dried a foot! | The ocean is a beast, aye, and the skies above its master, the winds its leash, and we men the fleas. | Lost I was! A summer adrift, the whole boat run through with hunting waters, each wave having taken a sailor for itself until only I remained, aye, aye! Tis the truth! By autumn, I saw land again, and so happy I was to see the trees and the mountains and the birds that dwell above both that I smashed my ship right into the rocks and kissed the sands as debris drifted about me. T\'was the happiest day of m\'life. | Never seen a great white whale before, but a green one? Aye. Wore a coat of moss, a stolen land fur if nothing else. We hunted it down with spears and ol\' sailor spirit. Alas, it realized we were on it when %randomname% - a man with the finest harpoon aim there is - struck it in the blowhole. I did not know a whale could turn \'round so quickly, but it did, and it made short work of our ship and drowned a number of sailors in a fit of vengenace. | I once caught a bass about, yeigh, big. Can you believe that? Alright, it was this big. Okay, maybe this big. Alright I\'ve never caught a bass. Fine! I\'ve never even seen a bass! I just know they\'re out there! Leave me alone you land lovers! I fish the big seas, dammit! I know nothing of your silly ponds. Except bass, of course, I know about them.}%SPEECH_OFF%",
