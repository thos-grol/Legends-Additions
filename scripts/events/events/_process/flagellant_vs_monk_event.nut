Their discussion is, at first, an easy one. The holy figure pleads with the flagellant to set aside his whip. While you don\'t necessarily wish to step in, you can\'t help but agree that destroying your own body on a glorified gore-schedule is not the best way to live. But then the flagellant retorts with something that gives you both pause. It is a phrase so well crafted that to think it might justify the man\'s personal habits has you pushing the notion out of your head as fast as possible. Disturbing, too, was the ease with which he said it. That such a soothing voice could be so warmly bundled in that scarred husk of flesh. What could muster it?\n\n The pious one stammers for a moment, but then puts hands to the flagellant\'s shoulders, holding him to keep their eyes on one another. Whispering words which tickle your ears, but don\'t pronounce themselves loud enough to have real meaning. You can only assume they are meant to, once again, persuade the flagellant to a better, less violent life.\n\n But, again, the flagellant begins to respond and so back and forth they continue to go.",

The flagellant\'s whip is in hand and you hear the leather slap against the clean back. He pulls the tool away and the sound of glass and barbs tearing flesh causes a ringing in your ears. The flagellant himself says nothing. He has set himself down by the religious one\'s side. He stares out across the land, but there is hardly a shimmer of life in his eyes, though you certainly see the blood of his life leaving his backside as he treats himself to a beating.\n\nYou step away once more, but the grass beneath your feet doesn\'t have the same crunch to it and the air carries a copper scent.
