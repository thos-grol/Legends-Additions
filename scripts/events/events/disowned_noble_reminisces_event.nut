I\'m a long ways away from it now, and the last I remember of it isn\'t exactly the best, yet I still find myself wishing to be there now and again.

But it\'s only good for a time. You look at the past, you acknowledge it, and then you move on. You have to be sure to only visit the past, not dwell in it.

I was picturing it with the hearth alight, smoke out of the chimney, soft candlelight beyond the windows, and my family there awaiting me. I was ignoring the locked door, the guard dogs squatting outside, and those I love telling me to never come back lest it\'s in a box to bury far beneath the earth. I wasn\'t thinking of my past so much as dreaming of it, and I think you\'ve helped me realize that, captain. Thank you.
