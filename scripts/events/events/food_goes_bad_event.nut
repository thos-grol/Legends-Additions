You now stare at the little spiderlings bubbling forth in a cloud of scuttling legs and bodies.\n\nThrowing the entire lot into a fire, you ask the brother to check the rest of the fish.

Unfortunately, it isn\'t long before you are lost in the midst of enormous stalks of green that pedal against your face with every rush of wind. The giggling doesn\'t stop, however, and you hear the pitter-patter of footsteps cross behind you and then in front. A voice speaks, sounding like a child deep in a well.%SPEECH_ON%Chase us! Over here! Chase us! Chase us... CHASE US. CHASE US NOW!%SPEECH_OFF%You suddenly feel no urge to retrieve the grain. You slowly put your sword back in its sheath and back out of the field. As you stare into the tall grass, it begins to part, slowly, like a piece of leather being torn at the seams. You hear horrible cries as each stem cracks in half.\n\n%randombrother% startles you when he asks what it is you\'re doing.
