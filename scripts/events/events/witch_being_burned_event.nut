The fires grow beneath them until the flames come licking their feet, then crawling up their legs, drawing them to cry out for mercy to which the crowds responds by throwing rocks.\n\nYou about draw your sword to end this injustice when %witchhunter_short% the witchhunter stays your hand. He shakes his head and points at the burnings. Soon enough, the begging stops and all three victims open their mouths, issuing forth a rumbling that silences the crowd and even the crackle of fire beneath them.
