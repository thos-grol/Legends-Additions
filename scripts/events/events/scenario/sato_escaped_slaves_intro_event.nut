Desperate for money, he first tried to ransom you and the other survivors, but finding no luck in the North, he turned to the South. You were sold to %vizierfullname%, proclaimed \'Indebted\' to the Gilder, and worked to the bone. Unperson in the eyes of the vizier, you got to experience firsthand the many wonders of the South: backbreaking labor under the cruel desert sun, mortal combat in the arena, and forced hunts for the terrifying creatures of the sands.";

You and your fellow slaves were forced into the service of a domineering southern officer tasked with clearing a nomad camp. He sent you indebted into the camp first to soften the raiders for his conscripts. That was when the Ifrit came. \'Chaos\' is the only word you possess to describe what ensued. A pure madness of sand and rock, of men crushed into bloody pulp by boulders lofted through the air, screaming and yelling and sand-filled lungs and a desert come to horrific life. When the battle began to rage into the officer\'s ranks, you saw your chance. You and your companions pilfered what you could from the battlefield, then ran. You ran like you\'ve never run before, straight through the night.";

You\'ll be caught eventually, and if you don\'t turn this group of miserable, downtrodden slaves into warriors soon, all of you will surely perish. You won\'t let that happen. You\'ve suffered with these men, shed sweat, blood, and tears together, and formed a bond of brotherhood stronger than any blood tie. Whether through mercenary work or common brigandry, you\'ll see them shaped into soldiers the likes of which %viziershortname% has never seen, and damn anyone who gets in your way.";
