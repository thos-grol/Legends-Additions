You walk over to see that %historian% is holding up a book filled with bodily descriptions and images. He states that it is the most accurate portrayal of the human body known to man, but the anatomists scoff, saying such a book doesn\'t exist for they have yet to write one. Interested, you take a look at the book. The drawings show man as a series of what look like very long worms, that flow to his heart and back out, each dedicated to one particular traversal. Other pages show the body parts laid out, showing lungs, kidneys, the liver, and more. It does seem rather detailed, but you\'re not exactly one to know who would ever be right in this case.%SPEECH_ON%Do not ascribe to that book\'s lies, captain. Let us anatomists do our work, so that such awful tomes may be put to the dust where they belong.%SPEECH_OFF%Furious, the historian snatches the book from your hand and shows a page to them. It has the human brain displayed, with numerous ropes or cords stretching out from it and down the spine. He states that this is central to the human experience, all that we are and all that we think we are is found in this organ. Again, the anatomists scoff. The historian turns to you, as though your layman\'s perspective might arbitrate the feelings of eggheads, and indeed every party present seems to wait on your word.}",

Even the historian protests, despite your defense of him.%SPEECH_ON%Just because it\'s in ink does not in anyway mean it is therefore automatically correct.%SPEECH_OFF%Sighing again, you ask who would waste ink on the wrong idea? Both the historian and the anatomists laugh at you for doubling down on such an absurd notion. They walk off together shaking their heads and muttering something about the laity.

We are men of action, and by action we will find the truth of all matters of this world, particularly those regarding its men and beasts alike. The idea that we read our way to this position is something we take offense to.%SPEECH_OFF%Sighing, you try to amend the issue, but now %historian% the historian jumps in.%SPEECH_ON%Captain, do you also see me in this light? That I have merely read my way to this position? I, too, can fight, you know? That is why I am here.
