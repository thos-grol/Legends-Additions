Reports of the bastards has died off in total, so I wager our money here has been put to good use. Leave the skin. I\'ve a man who can fix up some mean boots with it.%SPEECH_OFF%Did the %companyname% just work to get this fool new boots? You shake your head and make your leave. | %employer% welcomes you and your booty, a long, scratchy, scaly, scraping piece of stollwurm skin.

Your pay, as promised.%SPEECH_OFF%The man hands you a satchel heavy with well earned crowns. | %employer% is found warming himself beside a fire.

I\'ve heard tales of the reptilian sort carrying such tricks.%SPEECH_OFF%You shrug and state each creature was slain with as much scientific curiosity a good sword can muster. %employer% purses his lips.%SPEECH_ON%Ah. Right. Well your pay is in the corner there, as much as agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF%He returns to the fire, cozying himself up in a blanket and sipping at the lip of a steamy mug. | %employer% found outside and surrounded by raucous peasants. You yell over the crowd and display the stollwurm skin which you\'ve brought. The crowd quiets for a moment, whispers amongst its numbers, then returns to shouting. You purse your lips and elbow your way into the mob and demand the pay which you are owed. %employer% yells at the peons to spread out and let him breathe. While two guards stand close, he hands you a leather satchel.%SPEECH_ON%Good work, sellsword. If it ain\'t all there feel free to come back and kill me. I won\'t mind, not on this damned day.%SPEECH_OFF%As you take the satchel and leave, a peasant jabs his finger at the mayor.%SPEECH_ON%Tellin\' ya, that damned bastard, my supposed \'neighborly neighbor\', stole my birds and if he don\'t return them I\'mma burn his whole farm to the farkin\' ground!%SPEECH_OFF%}",
