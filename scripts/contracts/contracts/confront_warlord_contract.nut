I know, because it was my horse that died, its head turned backwards on account of one very angry greenskin.%SPEECH_OFF%Reminiscing is fine and good, but that\'s not why you\'re here. You subtly ask the nobleman to get to the point. He obliges.%SPEECH_ON%Right. The war with the greenskins isn\'t going as well as we\'d like, so I\'ve come to the conclusion that we must kill one of their warlords. Let me be honest with you: an orc that is physically superior to all its shite little brothers is a nightmare in flesh and blood. Best bet to draw him out is to kill as many of his greenskin brothers as you can. I know that sounds rough, but once this is all said and done our odds of winning this damned war will be vastly improved.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room. He\'s looking rather concernedly at a map.%SPEECH_ON%{My scouts have made reports of a warlord in the area, but we\'re not entirely sure where he is. I have a hunch that if you go out there and cause a lot of problems for these green bastards he just might come out and play. Understand? | We\'ve had reports coming in of an orc warlord roaming the lands. I believe if we can kill him, orc morale will drop and we might just win this damned war yet. Of course, he won\'t be easy to find. You\'ll have to get that big bastard to show himself and I believe the best way to do that is speaking the orcish tongue: killing as much as you can. Of course, kill the greenskins. Don\'t just be indiscriminate about this. | Glad you\'ve come, sellsword, because boy do I have a task for you. We\'ve gotten word that an orc warlord is in the region, but we know not where he is. I want you to go and practice a little bit of orcish diplomacy: kill as many of those green savages as you can and that warlord will for sure make himself known to you. If we can get him out of the picture, this war will be looking a hell of a lot prettier for our side.}%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is surrounded by his lieutenants and a very tired looking kid with muddied boots and a sweat slaked face. One of the commanders steps forward and takes you to a side.%SPEECH_ON%We\'ve gotten news of an orc warlord. That kid\'s family paid the price of seeing it with their own eyes. %employer% believes, and I concur with the lord, that if we can kill as many greenskins as possible that we might get this warlord to show himself.%SPEECH_OFF%You lean back and respond.%SPEECH_ON%And lemme guess, you want me to take its head?%SPEECH_OFF%The commander shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%It\'s not so much to ask, is it? My liege is willing to pay a lot of crowns for this job.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% sits amongst a pack of conked out dogs. There are pheasant feathers in their maws, fluttering between snoring breaths. The lord waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Come on in, sellsword. Just got done with a hunt. Coincidentally, I need to send you on one.%SPEECH_OFF%You take a seat. One of the dogs raises its head, huffs, then lowers it back to sleep. You ask what the nobleman wants. He quickly explains while rubbing one of the mutt\'s ears.%SPEECH_ON%I\'ve gotten word that an orc warlord is on the prowl. Where at? I\'ve no idea. But I think you can flush him out. You know just how, right?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and respond.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah. You keep killing its soldiers until it gets pissed enough to come out and fight you personally.

One of his scribes whispers into his ear then hurries to you.%SPEECH_ON%My liege has a request. We believe an orc warlord is in the region and, naturally, we want this savage put down. To do this, we...%SPEECH_OFF%You raise your hand and interrupt.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah, I know how to draw it out.

That\'s great!%SPEECH_OFF%Your eyes dim ever so gracefully, but you move on and start asking about the potential pay. | %employer% meets you in his study.

He opens it to a page and points at a garish image of an enormous orc.%SPEECH_ON%You know these, yes?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod. It\'s a warlord, the head of an orcish band and the cog around which a whirlwind of violence sputters about the world. The nobleman nods back and continues.%SPEECH_ON%I\'m doing a little bit of research on them as my scouts have brought me sightings of one. Of course, we can never fully keep track of this damned thing. It goes where it pleases, and wherever it goes, it destroys.%SPEECH_OFF%You stop the nobleman and explain to him a simple strategy: if you kill enough of the greenskins, the warlord will take offense, or perhaps be emboldened by the challenge, no one really knows, and it will come out to fight. %employer% smiles.%SPEECH_ON%You see, sellsword, this is why I like you. You know your shite. Of course, I think it\'s safe to assume this sort of thing isn\'t easy to do. The pay for it will be more than up to par.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is poring over a mound of scrolls his scribe is bringing in.

I thought you knew math!%SPEECH_OFF%The scribe ducks away, sniffling and staring at the floor as he hurries out of the room. You ask what the problem is. %employer% sighs and states that an orc warlord is in the region but they know not how to stop it. You laugh and answer.%SPEECH_ON%That\'s easy: you speak their language. You kill as many of those bastards as you can until that warlord is forced to come out and see you personally. Orcs love violence, they are born into it and probably even bred by it. Of course, actually killing the warlord isn\'t particularly easy...%SPEECH_OFF%%employer% leans forward and tents his fingers.%SPEECH_ON%Yes, of course not, but you do sound like the man for the job.

Here we have these things which are so green, yet those greenskin bastards are green, too, and I don\'t think they\'ve eaten a goddam vegetable in all their lives.%SPEECH_OFF%You want to say this is a pretty stupid observation, but hold your tongue. Instead, you ask what\'s the issue with the greenskins as that does seem to be the implied problem. %employer% nods.%SPEECH_ON%Right, of course. My scouts have spotted a warlord in the region. The problem is, we don\'t know where it is or where it goes. The scouts can\'t really stick with it for long or else they\'ll get killed for hopefully obvious reasons. I believe killing this warlord would help move us one step closer to ending this damned war, but I\'ve not a clue on how to do this, do you?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and respond.%SPEECH_ON%What has you wanting to kill the warlord, the fact he\'s killing your people, right? So what would get him to personally want to kill us? You kill as many of his bastards as you can.%SPEECH_OFF%The nobleman claps and tosses you a bright red tomato.%SPEECH_ON%That right there is good thinking, mercenary. Let\'s talk business!%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% and his commanders standing around a map. They pivot toward you as you enter the room like a bunch of hawks spotting a rabbit. The nobleman welcomes you in.%SPEECH_ON%Hello there, sellsword, we\'re a little on edge. Our scouts have reported an orc warlord is roaming the region as we speak. The problem is we\'re not entirely sure where it\'s going or how to find it. My commanders believe if we kill as many greenskins as possible, the warlord will show itself and then we can kill it. Do you think you\'re up to this task? If so, let\'s talk business.%SPEECH_OFF% | You step into %employer%\'s room to find him consulting with a group of scribes. They\'re visibly shaking, pinching their beady necklaces and squirming around. One of them points at you.%SPEECH_ON%Perhaps he has an idea?%SPEECH_OFF%The others scoff, but you ask what the problem is. %employer% explains that there is an orc warlord roaming the lands, but they\'re having issues tracking it. You nod dutifully then explain a very simple solution.%SPEECH_ON%Kill as many greenskins as you can and the warlord, but the prideful nature of the beast, will come out to fight you. Or, in this case, come out to fight... me?%SPEECH_OFF%%employer% nods.%SPEECH_ON%You\'ve got a good head on your shoulders, sellsword. Let\'s talk business.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% stands with his commanders over some maps.%SPEECH_ON%We\'ve got a hell of a task for you, sellsword. Our scouts have spotted a warlord roaming the region and we need you to kill as many greenskins as you can to draw it out of the woodwork. If we can take that warlord\'s head, we\'ll be much closer to ending this damned war.%SPEECH_OFF% | When you enter %employer%\'s room, he asks if you know anything about hunting orc warlords. You shrug and answer.%SPEECH_ON%They respond to the language of violence. So if you want to talk to one, you gotta kill a lot of its fellow orcs.
