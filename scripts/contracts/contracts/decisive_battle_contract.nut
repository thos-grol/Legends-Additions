The man picks his spear back up, catching it in his other hand.%SPEECH_ON%Whelp, back to it!%SPEECH_OFF% | The battle over, you find %commander% roaring and ripping off his armor and undershirt. He shows off his wounds, flexing so they open agape like seeping rinds of freshly cut fruit. He demands his men to do the same, turning each around so that he can see their back.%SPEECH_ON%You see, good warriors like us carry our wounds here, here, and here...%SPEECH_OFF%He points to every spot on the front of his body, and then he points to his back.%SPEECH_ON%But here, no man carries an injury here.

No, I had no intention of losing here and, if I did, I had no intention of being alive to witness my own defeat.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and respond.%SPEECH_ON%Rare is the man who gets to still be around to see his greatest defeat. It was good fighting with you, commander, but I must return to your employer now.%SPEECH_OFF%The commander nods and then turns around, yelling for someone to fetch him a towel. | You find %commander% squatting over a wounded enemy soldier. He\'s running a dagger along the poor man\'s chest, back and forth, scraping it along the armor. The commander looks at you.%SPEECH_ON%What do you think, sellsword? Should I let him live?%SPEECH_OFF%The prisoner stares at you, he juts his head forward, blinking hard. You suppose this is a \'yes.\' You shrug.%SPEECH_ON%That is not up to me.

The felled enemy seizes to the pain, but he quickly fades thereafter, going limp in mere moments. A gush of blood follows the blade\'s retrieval as the commander wipes it on his pantleg.%SPEECH_ON%Right to the heart, quick and easy. What man could hope for better?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and tell the commander that you are returning to your employer for your pay. | You watch as %commander% and a troop of soldiers bandy about the battlefield, killing any wounded enemies they discover. %randombrother% asks if we should report to the commander. You shake your head.%SPEECH_ON%No. We report to your employer. To hell with this place, let\'s go get paid.%SPEECH_OFF% | The battlefield is littered with the dead and those who wish they were. %commander%\'s men go about collecting their wounded and killing any enemies they find.

I wasn\'t sure if your men would hold their end of the bargain, but you damn well did. Your employer should be very happy to see you, I believe.%SPEECH_OFF% | You go around gathering the men of the %companyname%. %commander% comes to you, wiping a cloth over a sword, blood washing off in thick gobs.%SPEECH_ON%Leaving so soon?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod.%SPEECH_ON%Your employer is the one who is paying us, so to him we go.%SPEECH_OFF%The commander sheathes his weapon and nods back.%SPEECH_ON%Makes sense.
