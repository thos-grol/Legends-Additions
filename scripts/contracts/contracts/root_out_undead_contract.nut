The nobleman throws the stick at your feet and the pup leaps at it, crashing into your boots.%SPEECH_ON%That dog wouldn\'t so much as budge the other day, but now he can\'t stop playing. Now, if I were a gambling man, I\'d wager it may have something to do with you and those undead, sellsword. Good work. Your pay is %reward_completion% crowns, as promised, or you can take the puppy.%SPEECH_OFF%You say you\'ll take the puppy. The nobleman draws back with surprise.%SPEECH_ON%No, you\'ll take the crowns. The puppy stays with me.%SPEECH_OFF%Woof. | You step into %employer%\'s room to find the man staring out his window. He remarks with sanguine sincerity.%SPEECH_ON%Alive. It\'s all so alive.%SPEECH_OFF%He turns, revealing a satchel in hand. He walks over and gives it to you.%SPEECH_ON%%reward_completion% should be in there. Good work with the undead, sellsword, and may your services here put us one step closer to ending this evil altogether.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you with a flagon of wine. It carries a metallic taste, but you\'re sure to not comment on that. The nobleman carries a spry jaunt as he walks around to his desk.%SPEECH_ON%Good work, sellsword. Who knows what would have become of these lands if it weren\'t for men such as yourself. I pray to the old gods that, one day soon, we will be completely rid of all this evil!%SPEECH_OFF% | A guard meets you outside %employer%\'s room. He glances at you, particularly eyeing the %companyname%\'s badge on your shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Here, sellsword. %employer% is most busy, but he told me to tell you thanks.%SPEECH_OFF%You\'re given %reward_completion% crowns. | A pale, smooth skinned treasurer greets you in the halls to %employer%\'s room. He carries a satchel of crowns, quickly handing it to you.%SPEECH_ON%There\'s your payment in there, as agreed upon. My liege is currently most busy with his scribes to better solve this horrid undead problem.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% shaving, a tired and frowning woman holding up a mirror for him.%SPEECH_ON%Ho\', sellsword. Ouch. Hey.%SPEECH_OFF%He taps a razor into a basin of water before hurrying to his desk.%SPEECH_ON%My little birds have already told me of your doings. Not only that, but everyone seems all the better for it! The children laugh again, the sun shines bright, the crops are supposedly growing strong! Everyone is happy!%SPEECH_OFF%The woman asks if she can put the mirror down. The nobleman snaps his fingers.%SPEECH_ON%Hush, you. Now here, sellsword. %reward_completion% crowns, just as we agreed.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% not in his room, but in some darkened chamber with scant candles to provide light. There\'s a man in this dripping, soggy room hanging from some chains. Judging by his face, he looks as if he\'d rather be hanging from a rope. The nobleman stands with his arms behind his back while a black-hooded figure runs an indecisive finger along a tray of blades. You cough. %employer% spins around.%SPEECH_ON%Ah yes, sellsword! I\'d been expecting you! Here, %reward_completion% crowns, as promised. Hopefully the undead stay away for good this time. But, whatever happens, you\'ve done immense work in rooting the evil out of this world.%SPEECH_OFF%}",
