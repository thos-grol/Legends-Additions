It is all there -hic- there as promised. The peasantry is pleased, and I am pleased. Most pleased.%SPEECH_OFF%He gives one of the women a squeeze and she responds about as lively as a mottled rug. You grab the purse and go and a few of the lasses slip out the door with you as %employer% falls into a mumbling stupor. | You find %employer% outside his war room and in his library of which there are perhaps more shelves than books. But he seems impressed with himself all the same.%SPEECH_ON%Your work out there was splendid, sellsword. Absolutely splendid. Of course, there were casualties, but in the whole all things are where they should be and them southern shits have been sent running. With your help, our frontlines did not have to slacken to tend to the homes. Here, your %reward% crowns as promised.%SPEECH_OFF%When the man moves out of the way, you see he has stocked a freshly slickened skull on the shelf. He points at it with childish charm.%SPEECH_ON%It\'s one of their skulls. I\'m going to drink wine out of it, or piss into it. Haven\'t decided yet.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is sitting at his desk with a pyramid of three skulls. His hand rests atop it as though one would be patting the head of a dog. You notice that there are still strips of flesh and even hair on them, the bleaching process presumably hurried. The man speaks happily.%SPEECH_ON%My soldiers may stay upon the frontlines because of you, sellsword. Having handled these raiders not only saved the lives of many here, but perhaps prevented the fall of the first domino in a series of many. Without your help, the fathers and brothers and sons on the front may have fallen back to tend to their families and this whole war would have gone all fucked.%SPEECH_OFF%With his free hand, he pushes forward a purse.%SPEECH_ON%Your %reward% crowns. A well earned weight of coin, I\'d say.%SPEECH_OFF%He smiles grimly and cocks his head at the skulls.%SPEECH_ON%I\'d think they would agree, though I must say that in this affair I will be speaking for them.%SPEECH_OFF%}",
