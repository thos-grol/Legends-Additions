He\'s pointing toward the %item% which is dissolving before your very eyes! It turns to powder and you can only watch as a stream of it, like a fog taken to life, swirls around the room and zips right past your face and up the nose of the statue. Its eyes beam red and you immediately jump away. A sellsword comes to your side, his weapon already out.%SPEECH_ON%Sir, sir! Look!%SPEECH_OFF%There are shapes emerging from the walls! Statues that lurch forward like stringed puppets dangling from an old man\'s fingers. Slowly, each one discards its stony carapace and emerges as an odd looking, armor-clad and spear-wielding man. You quickly command your men into battle formation because whatever it is you have set free here isn\'t going to be friendly!}",
