You take it and the man flicks his wrist.%SPEECH_ON%That should be thanks enough, now please leave my sight.%SPEECH_OFF% | You show %employer% a head of an orc. He stares at it, then at you.%SPEECH_ON%Interesting. So should I take it that you\'ve completed what I\'ve asked of you?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod. The man smiles and hands over a wooden chest with %reward% crowns inside.%SPEECH_ON%I knew I could trust you, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% stares at you as you return.%SPEECH_ON%I\'ve heard of what you\'ve done.%SPEECH_OFF%It\'s a strange tone in his voice, a tone that has you quickly reviewing everything you\'ve done in the past week. Was that a noble woman at the... no, couldn\'t be.%SPEECH_ON%The orcs are dead. Good work, mercenary.%SPEECH_OFF%He slides you a satchel of %reward% crowns and a wave of relief also washes over you. | You enter %employer%\'s room and take a seat, pouring yourself a cup of wine. The nobleman stares a hole through you.%SPEECH_ON%I dare say that\'s a drawing-and-quartering offense, a hanging one if I\'m feeling kind, a burning one if I ain\'t.%SPEECH_OFF%You finish the drink and then slam an orc head on the man\'s table. The cup totters and rolls around on its side. %employer% reels back, then calms himself.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, yes, a drink well earned. That wasn\'t my best wine, anyway. %randomname%, my guard, is waiting for you outside. He\'ll have the %reward% crowns we agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF% | You lift an orc head to show %employer%. The green maw falls open, its tongue lolling between the teeth one might mistake for tusks. %employer% nods and flicks his hand.%SPEECH_ON%Please, have some mercy for my dreams and take it away.%SPEECH_OFF%You do as told. The man shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%How am I to get any sleep these days with things like that being lugged around? Anyhow, you have %reward% crowns already waiting for you outside with one of my guards. Thanks for your work, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come to %employer%\'s room to find him looking at a drawing on a scroll. He stares at you, the lip of the paper folding backward.%SPEECH_ON%My daughter thinks herself an artist, can you believe that?%SPEECH_OFF%He shows you the scroll. It\'s a pretty well done drawing of a man who looks suspiciously like %employer%. The drawn figure is facing a hangman. %employer% laughs.%SPEECH_ON%Dumb girl.%SPEECH_OFF%He crumples the scrolls and tosses it aside.%SPEECH_ON%Anyway, my spies have already told me of your successes.
