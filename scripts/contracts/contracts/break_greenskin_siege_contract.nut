You step over the mounds of corpses, man and beast alike, collecting your men for the march back. | Bodies litter the field, clouds of flies already starting to gather and busy themselves. You gather your men and prepare a return to %employer% for your pay. | %objective% is saved! Well, what\'s left of it. Soldiers and greenskins, dead and dying, litter the ground as far as the eye wants to see. It\'s a cruel sight, so freshly produced. You order the %companyname% to prepare to return to %employer% for your pay. | Mounds of corpses stacked two, three, sometimes even four bodies high. Survivors are found buried beneath these dead, six-feet under despite being above ground. It is a horrific sight, and an even worse display of sound as the wounded and dying call out for help. Spotting them in the sea of body parts is like trying to find a sailor bobbing atop a dark ocean. You turn away from the scene and gather the men of the %companyname%. %employer% should be happily awaiting your return. | The battle won and over, you watch as pike-armed men carefully traipse the field. They use the weapon-given distance to safely dispatch any wounded greenskins still lying about. The rest of the noble soldiers sink to the ground, drinking water and washing the blood from their faces. You\'ve no time for such rest and quickly gather your sellswords to return to %employer%. | Blood muddies the earth and your boots sink deep into the muck. Corpses lay about, bodies rendered unfamiliar, body parts detached and spread far from their owners. Decapitated heads here and there, eyes frozen in shock. Broken arrows, splintered spears, deserted swords. Parts of shattered armor crinkling underfoot. It was one hell of a battle and it has certainly left its mark for all to come and see.\n\n With %objective% saved, you slowly gather the %companyname% to return to %employer% for its big payday. | The battle over, the noble soldiers spare no time in decapitating every greenskin they can find. They stab the heads onto pikes and raise them high, mirroring the barbarity of the savages they\'d just dispatched. You\'ve no time for such theatrics. %objective% is saved and that is what you will be paid for. The %companyname% quickly gathers for a return trip to %employer%. | The battle over, you carefully step across the field. Each corpse tells a story of how it came to be. Some stabbed in the back, others without heads, their stories somewhere else, others yet have been gutted and are found clutching their innards with shocked expressions of having been witness to things not meant to be seen. Nothing new, all the same, just a different place. What matters most is that %objective% is still standing. You gather the %companyname% to return to %employer% and receive your pay. | %randombrother% comes to your side. He\'s holding the head of a greenskin, but quickly tosses it away as if whatever novelty there was to it had just faded. He puts his hands to his hips and nods at the battlefield.%SPEECH_ON%Well, that\'s something.%SPEECH_OFF%Corpses, sometimes stacked three or four high, litter the ground. Limbs twisting, faces strained, blood heard leaking. Men march through it, their legs retching great sprays of pooled blood as though they were marching through a creekbed. %objective%, burning it may be, still stands in the distance and that\'s all that matters to you. The %companyname% should now return to %employer% for its pay. | The siege has been lifted, though the greenskins did not give it up willingly. Dead men and beasts litter the land as far as you can see and no doubt accurately fulfill any imagination beyond. %randombrother% comes to your side. He lifts a strap of green flesh off his shoulder and whips it away like a wet rag.%SPEECH_ON%Hell of a fight, sir.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and order him to prepare the men. %employer% should be most happy to hear that %objective% has been saved.}",
