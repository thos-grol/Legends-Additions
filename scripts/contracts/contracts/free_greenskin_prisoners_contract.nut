Thinking themselves already dead, most of the prisoners break down in tears and thank you for rescuing them. All in a day\'s work, really. | The greenskins have been defeated and you quickly head into their camp. You find the prisoners in a tent, huddled together with no clothes. The freedmen can hardly speak, but their eyes tell a lot about the horrors they\'ve experienced. %randombrother% goes and gets some blankets to cover them up for the return trip to your employer, %employer%. | The greenskins have been dealt with, now you and your men start picking through their abandoned camp. You immediately hear people screaming from a tent. %randombrother% opens the flap to see a goblin waving a hot iron in front of a group of huddled, naked men. The sellsword cuts the creature\'s head off in a single swipe before it can even realize the reversal in its fortunes. The prisoners cry out, thanking you for the rescue. Your employer, %employer%, should be most pleased that at least some of his men will be coming home. | The greenskins defeated, you and the %companyname% rush into their encampment. There you find a goblin poking and prodding a man who has died from torture. %randombrother% grabs the unwitting goblin and puts a blade through the back of its skull. You follow blood trails into a nearby tent to find a group of blindfolded men huddled together. They skirt away from your voice, but you quickly make it clear that you\'re here to help them. The poor souls have been through a lot. Returning them to your employer, %employer%, and their homes should make for a good recovery. | Any thought the greenskins\' had about coming out ahead in that fight have been put to rest: those savages are quite thoroughly dead.\n\nYou order the men to start searching through their encampment to try and find the prisoners. It isn\'t long until %randombrother% finds the men huddled underneath a tent. They\'ve been beaten and tortured, but they\'ll live. A few thank you, and most others thank the old gods. Damn deities stealing your thunder yet again. Anyway, your employer, %employer%, will be most pleased. | The %companyname% dispatches the greenskins with ease and quickly rushes into their abandoned encampment. The horrors there are beyond comprehension. Men skewered on spits, others tentpoled into the sky on the ends of enormous stakes. Thankfully, there is still light in all this dark: the prisoners you were looking for are found. They\'re badly beaten, but they are alive. | The greenskins have been defeated. You venture into their encampment to find horrors glistening freshly red. Flayed figures strung up against racks of twisting thorn and tree branches. Grey bodies disemboweled, their gaunt and stretched faces still witnessing a most grotesque undoing. More men are found in a shallow trench, bound face down into frothy waters, great boulders placed upon their backs so they drowned with breath but an inch away.\n\nNot only are you worrying that there are no survivors, a part of you is hoping there are none. Such horrors were not meant to be carried forward. Unfortunately, %randombrother% beckons you over to a tent. Inside, a few prisoners huddle together, naked and shrinking from your presence. You order the %companyname% to get the men dressed, fed, and watered for the return trip to your employer, %employer%. | The %companyname% defeats the greenskins with relative ease and ducks into the savages\' encampment. There you find humans made into holy totems, great obelisks of glistening bone and cairns of tilted skulls. %randombrother% calls you over to one of the goatskin tents. You rush over to find a few prisoners there, each squared away into a cage of tightly folded metal barbs. Each man is carefully freed, and each man opens up about the horrors which they had endured. You ensure the men that they will be returned to their families. | Having defeated the greenskins, you quickly rush into their camp to find the prisoners. They are seen latched to a long black chain. A frail orc with crooked eyes and malformed hands is trying to make off with the men. %randombrother% rushes forth and clubs the greenskin over the back of the head. It drops to the ground and rolls over onto a bulbous back. The misshapen and deformed creature calls out in an unlearned shout, some retardation of language beyond even the brutish orcish tongue. %randombrother% hesitates a moment, the orc\'s eyes only witness to a world it never understood, and then the man grits his teeth and stoves the creature\'s head in.\n\nYou free the prisoners who explain that they were about to be carted off by what might have been the tribe\'s idiot. Either way, they\'re saved now and %employer% will be most pleased to have them back! | The greenskins have been defeated and the prisoners are quickly saved from the savages\' encampment. Each prisoner has a story of horror to tell, even the ones who speak not a word. Your employer, %employer%, will be most pleased. | Your employer, %employer%, probably didn\'t trust that this would happen, but after defeating the greenskins and driving into their encampment you manage to save the prisoners!

Thinking themselves already dead, most of the prisoners break down in tears and thank you for rescuing them. All in a day\'s work, really. | The greenskins\' ambush failed and so you head into their camp. Any lurking greenskins quickly run off, abandoning everything. You find the prisoners in a tent, huddled together with no clothes. %randombrother% goes and gets some blankets to cover them up for the return trip to %employer%. The freedmen can hardly speak, but their eyes tell a lot about the horrors they\'ve experienced. | The ambush has been dealt with, now you and your men start picking through the greenskins\' abandoned camp. You immediately hear people start screaming from a tent. %randombrother% opens the flap to see a goblin waving a hot iron in front of a group of huddled, naked men. The sellsword cuts the creature\'s head off in a single swipe. The prisoners cry out, thanking you for the rescue. %employer% should be most pleased that at least some of his men will be coming home. | The ambush defeated, you and the %companyname% rush into the greenskins\' encampment. There you find a goblin poking and prodding a man who has ostensibly died from torture. %randombrother% grabs the unwitting goblin and pummels it to death. You search a nearby tent to find a group of blindfolded men huddled in a corner. They skirt away from your voice, but you quickly make it clear that you\'re here to help them. The poor souls have been through a lot. Returning them to %employer% and their homes should make for a good recovery. | Any thought the greenskins\' had about coming out ahead in that fight have been put to rest: those savages are thoroughly dead.\n\nYou order the men to start searching through their encampment to try and find the prisoners. It isn\'t long until %randombrother% finds the men huddled underneath a tent. They\'ve been beaten and tortured, but they\'ll live. A few thank you, and most others thank the old gods. Damn deities stealing your thunder yet again. Anyway, %employer% will be most pleased. | The %companyname% dispatches with the ambush and quickly rushes into the greenskins\' abandoned encampment. You find a man on a spit roasting over a fire. Another is hanging from a tree with his feet cut off. Screaming carries your attention to a nearby tent where you find the rest of the men huddled together and begging for water. Your men start handing out water and tending to their wounds. They\'ll need to be able to walk to get back to %employer% and their homes. | The ambush destroyed, you quickly sweep through the greenskins\' camp. You find a few stragglers, including a goblin trying to make off with a bundle of trophy skulls. %randombrother% makes the savage pay for its gruesome greed with its own head.\n\nIt\'s not long until you find the prisoners huddled together under a sheepskin tent. One cries out.%SPEECH_ON%I knew the old gods would answer our prayers!%SPEECH_OFF%You ask if the old gods will also undo their bindings. The curious, philosophical question goes unanswered when %randombrother% rushes in and frees the prisoners. Ultimately, %employer% will be happy to see them no matter who or whatever is responsible for their rescue. | The greenskins\' laid low, you and the %companyname% sweep through their encampment, slaughtering every straggler you find. The prisoners are freed from a pit in the ground where they had to piss and shit for days, it seems. They kiss the ground and thank you for the rescue. %employer% should be most pleased with this result. | The ambush has been taken care of, but what of the prisoners? You quickly rush into the abandoned greenskin encampment to find the prisoners tied to a series of posts. Unfortunately, the man at the far end has already been tortured to death. Judging by his still leaking wounds, you were just a bit too late. The rest of the prisoners scream out in ecstasy, though. One after the other kisses the earth before your feet. However, now is not the time to feel good about yourself. %employer% will be expecting you with his own thanks: a big pile of crowns.}",

Pots of stew are turned over and there\'s fresh fires they were quickly left behind. %randombrother% opens a goatskin tent to find the prisoners huddled together. They praise the old gods at the very sight of you. %employer% will be happy with this result, and you\'re happy that the greenskins gave up without a fight. | The greenskins\' camp is abandoned. You find the charred remains of a pig left over as pit and some stews kicked over. They definitely left in a hurry.\n\n%randombrother% calls you over. The prisoners are in a hole in the ground with water up to their waists. A spiked wooden gate is stopping them from getting out, though its tangled with bloodied clothes which suggests at least one man tried. You quickly raise the cover and help them out. You look down to see one body floating in the water. They\'re not all coming back, but %employer% should be more than happy about these few lucky souls. | You rush into the greenskins\' encampment to find the tents all spilt over and a great rush of footsteps leading away from it. They abandoned in it a quick hurry. %randombrother% laughs.%SPEECH_ON%Looks like they knew the %companyname% was coming.%SPEECH_OFF%Suddenly, a voice breaks out of one of the tents, screaming and hollering. You rush over to find a man in hysterics, splayed out on the ground while a bunch of blindfolded men huddle in the corner. The prisoners. Missing fingers, toes, eyes, noses, limbs, the tick tock of time spent in the company of greenskins. You shake your head and order the men to start handing out care. %employer% will be happy about their being alive, but these men are most certainly forever broken. | The greenskins\' camp is empty. A few black birds squawk and fight over some spilt stew while feral dogs scamper at the very sight of you. Your men start searching through the goatskin tents left behind. There\'s nothing to be found until your foot suddenly depresses a little further into the ground than it should. You crouch down and swipe the camouflage away to reveal a trapdoor. Lifting it, you find a well chute the greenskins\' had converted into a very vertical jail cell. The prisoners are squeezed together like tinder and look up at the light with withered, water-worn faces. %randombrother% looks down and grunts.%SPEECH_ON%Well, they\'re alive. I\'ll go get some rope.%SPEECH_OFF% | Footprints trail away from the camp. Judging by the spacing and littering of rubbish, they were in a hurry. %randombrother% calls out to you. He\'s standing outside a tent holding the flap open. When you get there, you see that it was used to house the prisoners. They\'re all naked and on the ground, ears plugged with twigs and eyes blindfolded. Looks like they\'ve been beaten into not moving unless asked. There\'s a pile of human limbs in a corner and it looks like something had taken to using their skulls for primitive artwork. You shake your head.%SPEECH_ON%Free them and give them water. %employer% was probably hoping for the best with getting these men back, but this is just about what I expected.%SPEECH_OFF% | The greenskins\' had abandoned their camp. You\'re not sure why, but most likely their scouts sighted your company and made a business decision to get out while they still could.\n\nThe men are ordered to look for the prisoners and it\'s not long until they\'re found: a goatskin tent with the men huddled beneath a pole with their hands bound and faces literally buried in the dirt. They\'ve been given straws to breathe. %randombrother% hurries over and starts taking their heads out of the ground. Each man\'s face is purpled and gasping for air, but they\'re alive and the torture over. %employer% should be happy to see them coming back. | The encampment is found empty. %randombrother% picks up a spilt cauldron which leaks more sewage than stew. He drops it and shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%Fire\'s still crackling. They left in a hurry.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and order the men to fan out and look for the prisoners. No sooner than the words leave your lips do you hear someone screaming from a nearby tent. Inside, you find the prisoners - or those who have survived. On one side of the room the living are naked and huddled. On the other you see a pool of blood, an execution block, a red-stained mallet, and a couple of bodies pinched off at the heads like flowers used for bookmarks. %employer% won\'t be getting all his men back. | Entering the greenskins\' encampment, {you find a goblin shoveling bones into a knapsack. It quickly drops its belongings. %randombrother% runs it down and puts a blade through it. | you find a wounded orc leaning against a pole. He\'s breathing heavy, but with a quick stab of his blade %randombrother% make sure he\'s not breathing at all.} The rest of the camp has been seemingly abandoned, this greenskin the last to remain. You find the prisoners in a tent. They\'ve been blindfolded and a few are missing fingers or toes. %employer% will be most pleased. | The encampment has been abandoned, but the prisoners left behind. You rescue them, or what\'s left of them: some have had their fingers and toes removed, others breathe through holes where their noses used to be. But they\'re alive. That\'s what matters, right? | You come into an encampment which has been abandoned in a hurry. The greenskins most likely saw the %companyname% coming and made a smart decision to leave while they still could. The prisoners are, thankfully, found alive. They thank the old gods and bow before you like paupers before an oracular sage. You get the poor survivors water and prepare a return to %employer%. | A single orc is found at the encampment. It\'s resting against a cage where the prisoners are housed. One of the prisoners has a chain around the greenskin\'s neck and is pulling it against the bars, warden and prisoner clasped in a most ironic struggle. %randombrother% rushes over and puts a blade through the orc\'s eye and frees the men. The prisoners rush out of the cage kissing the earth and jumping for joy. A giddy man explains that the greenskins left in a hurry and it seems they were mighty scared.
