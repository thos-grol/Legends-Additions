With a loud snap their spine and skull shatters on the soft sand — killing them near instantly.\n You are losing precious time and the sand is covering the more important set of tracks — you assemble a crude cairn for the body beneath the old silos and move on.\n\n As you leave, the mud brick monoliths stand silent, watching.
