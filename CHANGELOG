CHANGELOG

2.0 - Major Update
Updated to legends 18.2.X

origins
- Removed all origins except for Escaped Slaves which will be reworked (I'm not going to balance all the origins)
- This is preparation for roguelike mode if MSU persistence is released

stat changes
- All stats are planned to have more uses in the future - reaching certain thresholds will transform/improve the character and their skills

- merged Melee Skill and Ranged Skill into Attack. All units have 100% of skill into melee attacks and 50% into ranged attacks by default. This frees up a stat slot to display
    - Ranged focus backgrounds will have the "Ranged Focus Trait" that reverses this. Ranged Proficiency will change the conversion to 75% or the highest number.
    - fixed effects using ranged attack
    - fixed skills using ranged attack
    - fixed injuries using ranged attack

merged Melee Defense and Ranged Defense into one skill. Warriors are probably better at dodging melee strikes than arrows. Ranged Defense will be 75% of Melee Defense
    - remove ranged defense stat from shields
    - fixed effects using ranged defense
    - fixed perks and skills using ranged defense
    - fixed injuries using ranged defense
- implemented strength stat - every point is 1% of increased damage.
- implemented reflex stat - every point is 1% chance to downgrade a critical hit (head hit) to a body hit or a body hit to a graze (10% damage)

- changed graphics and arrangement of stats
    //renamed stats and change stat descriptions



- standardized background strengths and weakened enemy strengths to reflect this: stat rolling has been removed from backgrounds and trait trees. This should make the game feel better even with your shit peasant recruits. Now stat rng depends only the traits a character recieves. The background has uses unrolled stats as a baseline. EVERYTHING in the game will now be balanced around the daytaler's stats. This should be more logical and organized:

    Hitpoints -> Vitality - Concerning the strength of life of the character. Base 50.
    Fatigue -> Endurance - Concerning the character's ability to endure in battle. Base 100.
    Resolve -> Will - Concerining the character's strength of will, can be used in magic checks. Affects morale changes. Base 50.
    Initiative -> Agility - Concerning the character's speed.

    Attack - Character's ability to attack. Base 50
    Defense - Character's ability to defend. Base 10.
    Strength (new stat) - Concerning the damage the character can do. Each point adds 1% damage to relevant attacks. Base 10.
    Reflex - Concerning the character's ability to react. Each point has a 1% chance to downgrade a critical hit (headshot) to a bodyshot. And a hit to a graze. (10% of damage).

- Removed leveling up melee skill and melee def for player and enemy. It was always arms race between you and enemy to level these up - ie. it was autopick. Now you can vary your stat levelups among the 6 other stats.
    As for methods to improve attack and defenses it would be training, events, future class promotions, and perks

Enemies
- TODO: All humans and monsters have been rebalanced to the above standards as a guideline. Note that monsters will be way beyond human strength. reworked 50-100+ enemies to reflect new stats

- you can't parry magic anymore

TODO:bug fixes


2) Weakness (applied by cleavers) have the wrong formula for damage reduction, it practically reduces damage to 0
4) Death dealer does not reduce fat costs of aoe skills, most likely the same is true for Wrath (haven't actually tried the latter yet). This is because skills reset their fat cost after these perks change it and they do not consider these perks at all
6) Librarian drop is seemingly unchanged from base legends, this might result in the player getting items which were supposed to be removed
1) Crossbows claim an armor ignore percent of 75%, while in reality shoot bolt and shoot heavy bolt only has 45% and 50% ignore respectively (being a sharpshooter, whatever that means, stealthily adds another 5%)
2) Polearm mastery (proficiency) does not reduce the ap cost of most polearm skills, as far as I can tell only the skills of pure polearms (so not spetums which are spear/polearm) and for some reason the primary attack of the longaxe
3) Crafting possibly not working (see Mage of Winter potion)
