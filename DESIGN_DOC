Theoretical Framework for Dungeon

- Dungons consists of stages
    - each stage has a deck of encounters - random events or fights
        - boss discovered (enables option to fight boss in screen)
        - X amount of treasure cards - 10%, treasure deck
        - encounter deck - 80%
        - event deck - 10%

        example screen:
        Area description
        Treasures found X/X

        Choices
            - Explore (Will draw from deck after rolling for which deck)
            - Challenge Boss (Hidden until unlocked)
            - Go Deeper (Hidden until boss defeated)
            - Leave

Spawn 1 castle of night per playthrough

First Dungeon:

Castle of Night
This area is shrouded by eteranl night. In front of you looms a tangle of trees, a dense dark wood no doubt the scene where many have lost their lives. In the distance looms a majestic castle....'

The Woods
There seems to be some strange magic in these woods. Though you can see the castle in the distance, the distance in the woods does not shrink.

Treasure Deck:

3 Named Items

1 Artefact
- Rueful Axe, found in the forest
    A cursed axe with a cursed story
    drawn by hatred - enemies will be massively drawn to kill this character

        the price is paid in blood - select a random brother in your party. if you take that axe, that brother will die
        otherwise you lose the chance to take the axe forever

- Chain of Anguish
    Chain that inflicts anguish on those it strikes, decreasing their ap and has a high armor piercing
    Negative side effect is that the bearer has a chance of taking part of the damage they inflict (luck can influence this chace) and that each strike has a chance of creating a ghost to seek revenge from the weilder


- Sword of Decay

- Cursed Handgonne, used by the gatekeeper
    - every third shot fired will definitely hit the shooter
    - unequipping the weapon will die

Boss: The Fool
- black jester helm - drop as loot, false. ending event will reward the hat
    - nihil - transform greed, hate, despair, and wrath traits into more powerful versions
        "Did you make me, or did I make you?"
        - greed (greedy)
            Happiness became obsession, obsession became greed...
            - every time an enemy is hit, roll (can be influenced by luck)
                - if this character is higher, recover 5-10 HP
                - else lose 5-10 HP
        - hate (any hate trait)
            love turned into hatred...
            - upon missing an attack, become staggered
            - upon missing 3 attacks, reduce the AP cost of attacks by 1 (max 2)
        - despair (deathwish)
            when vows turned awry and the heart became hollow, all that was left was despair...
            - every time this character is hit, gain 10% damage reduction (up to 50%)
            - on turn start if this character was hit, X% chance to lose 5 AP. X is the % damage reduction
        - wrath (bloodthirsty)
            - betrayal was the seed of wrath...
            - gain x% damage
            - on turn start, attack a random character. if there are no allied characters within attack range of this character, there will be a rising chance to attack themselves

        if all 4 traits are found on this character, the traits lose their negative effects.
        all characters around this character are afflicted with nihil

     - unequipping will die


---

The Castle of Night
    Treasure: blood magic book
        - convert health to mana
        - bats teleport
        - blood needles - fires needles of blood that infect the target and causes bleed
            - blood harvest - all bleeding units within 3 tiles will take 5 damage. Will heal the caster 2 for each enemy damaged this way
        - blood explosion - detonate the infected blood, causing damage for each infection stack. if the enemy dies, inflict blood needle to all units in 2 tile radius


Encounter deck:
    Bloodthirsty Servant (has necrosavant powers) stage I

    Dream - [O]utside the ordered universe [is] that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity—the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

    The dream is the origin of all mysteries, and the end of all mysteries. And herein lies it's secret doctrine.
