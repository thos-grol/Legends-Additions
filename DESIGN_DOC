======== BUILDS ===========

General 1h builds (all 1h weps) =
-straight boring duelist
-dueling duelist: with parry dagger
-utility duelist: with offhand training (usually a 1h mace) and stacked with nets
-1h axe headshot build: (uses heft to go for 'domes')
-1h 3-head flail with feint and fast adaptation (this one is a beaut! I'm known for my love of flails and 3-head and reach flails are king!)
-1h spear dodge overwhelm: best 1v1 'duelist' in the game (doesn't use duelist perk though, practically unbeatable in 1v1, 4 stacks of overwhelm at super high speeds)

General 2h builds (most 2h weps are ok with these)
-generic 2h'er: main 2h wep
-2h sword MoB: fatigue neutral build that lets you AOE every turn... one of my most disgusting and reliable builds
-2h 'round spin': probably MoB so you can spin in a circle every turn with a 2h axe/flail (only ever did this build on a lone wolf, not a common/workable build with allies around lol and the fatigue is expensive without mob)

Reach weapons:
-2h flail reach: 2 types of builds, MoB and generic (disgusting infinite headshot build, can just use rebound for basic, but headhunter with MoB is very strong)
-general polearm/reach weapon: followup with recover, keeps people pretty strong in your backline
-2h reach cleav: big numbers with mauler ðŸ™‚ (also super scary with follow-up)
-support mace: (with MoB you can make a support reach mace that can stun every turn, they're very nice indeed, maybe even polearm mastery so they can move 2 spaces every turn before stunning)

Ranged builds:
-obv. throwing deleter: throwing with muscularity (i forgot, muscularity in multi-attacks-per-turn-builds are a strong help) javelins delete people, 2-shotting footmen is fun!
-slinger headshot build: yeah, it's definitely fun lol (push the advantange feeds back on a slinger's successful headshot for more headshots)
-perfect focus archer: crazy first turn, recover next turn, rinse repeat and you'll knock out multiple kills in your 'attacking' turns)
-over/fear/feint/gunner: the gunner that does everything (usually don't have enough perks to make it) but feint, and fearsome are a great way to make gunners 'fun' ðŸ˜›

Tanks:
-dodge nimble: generic speedy tank, hates nets and staggers and nomads.... super tricky but super rewarding if you don't have enemy stagger sand such (hates goblins & nomads)
-medium bonus stats: saves your weaker tanks from dying with good balance (or just in general a good tank, still doesn't like staggers, but more forgiving imo)
-generic BF wall: heaviest armour, 'nimble attachment' (a.k.a fur padding) makes the best tank imo, can take big hits and cbow/armour pierce isn't as bad
ALSO
different ways to fluff up your tank.
-rebound for infinite shieldwalls
-or, tower shield to get best def without needing a shieldwall (can't really ever get MoB tanks imo, too many stats and getting fortify every turn is too hard [usually the same with indomitable sadly])

Banner/support builds:
-holy magic bros: monks and such with MoB. resolve and fatigue to support with heals, free def (and if banner is added, you can use inspiring presence)
-rally banner: can be used with ^holy magic^, just need to have high res as usual and MoB
-musician: drumming/singing perks, maybe even have 'entice'/'revolt' (the ranged shield bash is a very nice support ability imo)
-I've combined a holy magic support and a tank before on one of my stream/YT playthroughs iirc (was a fun combo lol, did decently)
-ohh and with all supports/banners, inspire is great ofc.
