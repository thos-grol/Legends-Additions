//Faction Overhaul
    //every settlement spawns guards, guards vary in strength
    //update action
        faction action <- factions have a chance to build strength during update
            combine multiple contract checks into update action,
            contract expiring can raise bandit faction strength
            contract completion can raise settlement strength/security
            settlements store monster strength, create witcher necrophages?

    //military action <- suppress menace

    //function buildSettlements( _rect )

    //Predefine noble house
        //function createNobleHouses( _num )
        //function assignSettlementsToNobleHouses( _nobleHouses )
            //upon assigning settlement to noble house, you can edit the buildings and attached locations?

    //Building camps only occur when faction strength reaches threshold to expand
    //Factions with no camps remain dormant until later
    //Contracts are only generated when faction strength reaches a certain ammount

    //timed out contracts: contractmanager, function update( _force = false ), c.isTimedOut()

//FEATURE_8: dungeon, source of money when no contracts

Schools:
    Origin - The tides of magic have waned. This world is undergoing the end of the dharma... where fantasy is wasting away. The only miracles left are the remnants of the gods, inner or outer... The mainstream power of this world is blasphemy... using the remains of the gods to achieve power.

    Winter - Silence and death. The dead. The end.
    Heart - Unrelenting optimism. The beating of the heart keeps the world running. Preservation. Continuation. Thunder.
    Grail - Desire and birth. The feast. The color red. Gluttony. Vampires.
    Moth - Desire to change. Transformation.
    Lantern - The light of knowledge with no mercy. Certainty and uncertainy. Fate and luck. Divination.
    Forge - Shaping and fire. Runelore.
    Edge - The secrets of the blade and battle.

    Dream - [O]utside the ordered universe [is] that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinityâ€”the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

    The dream is the origin of all mysteries, and the end of all mysteries. And herein lies it's secret doctrine.

////CHANGELOG
//Economy Rework - Countering inflation.
A problem in the game was that eventually you would reach the point where money was worthless while you have hundreds of thousands of crowns. The economy rework tries to fix this through many ways to make you feel the struggles of managing a mercenary company (poverty).

# Scale
- Shrunk down the scale of a crown so that each crown is worth more. Now you will feel that 100 crowns is a lot of money.
- Reworked event and contract prices to match.
- At the same time, hiring and keeping bros is much, much cheaper, but armor and weapons are expensive.

# Input - restrict the amount of money flowing in
- Most npcs will not be walking money trees dropping expensive items anymore.
- Stores wont buy most random junk at all.
- Removed a lot of freebies given through events etc.
- Removed legends money printing skills like lumber etc.

# Ouput - create channels for money to flow out
