//TODO: fearsome perk description



	//

//Magic has a cast chance - then a hit chance.

//Ideas
	//Luck - increases the chances of effects occuring. Bad luck decreases it.

	//Fragile - takes more injuries
	//Open Wounds - increases the damage of applied bleed.
	//Stagger
	//Slower

	//Bleeding
	//Poison

	//Daze
	//Stun

//TODO: weapon mastery system for retinue, trained tree as well
    // Add effect that records the weapon type of the currently equipped weapon.

    // Description: Trains all weapons and shields.
        // function onTargetHit( _skill, _targetEntity, _bodyPart, _damageInflictedHitpoints, _damageInflictedArmor )
        // add total damage to exp. Once damage accumulates enough add tree.

        //every time attack misses and character has shield equipped, gain a random ammount of shield exp.
    //Will display currently training message.

//TODO: make some backgrounds have garunteed stats/traits, ie. lumberjacks will come with weapon proficiency
    Weapon mastery perks renamed to weapon proficiency -> becomes status effect. When mastered, grant stance to user.
    Choose 1 of 2 stances for each weapon.
    Masters can transform your stance into different stance.

            power die + spell roll die = effect damage

Schools:
    Origin - The tides of magic have waned. This world is undergoing the end of the dharma... where fantasy is wasting away. The only miracles left are the remnants of the gods, inner or outer... The mainstream power of this world is blasphemy... using the remains of the gods to achieve power.

    Winter - Silence and death. The dead. The end.
    Heart - Unrelenting optimism. The beating of the heart keeps the world running. Preservation. Continuation. Thunder.
    Grail - Desire and birth. The feast. The color red. Gluttony. Vampires.
    Moth - Desire to change. Transformation.
    Lantern - The light of knowledge with no mercy. Certainty and uncertainy. Fate and luck. Divination.
    Forge - Shaping and fire. Runelore.
    Edge - The secrets of the blade and battle.

    Dream - [O]utside the ordered universe [is] that amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the center of all infinity—the boundless daemon sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes.

    The dream is the origin of all mysteries, and the end of all mysteries. And herein lies it's secret doctrine.

            Defensive:

////CHANGELOG
//Economy Rework - Countering inflation.
A problem in the game was that eventually you would reach the point where money was worthless while you have hundreds of thousands of crowns. The economy rework tries to fix this through many ways to make you feel the struggles of managing a mercenary company (poverty).

# Scale
- Shrunk down the scale of a crown so that each crown is worth more. Now you will feel that 100 crowns is a lot of money.
- Reworked event and contract prices to match.
- At the same time, hiring and keeping bros is much, much cheaper, but armor and weapons are expensive.

# Input - restrict the amount of money flowing in
- Most npcs will not be walking money trees dropping expensive items anymore.
- Stores wont buy most random junk at all.
- Removed a lot of freebies given through events etc.
- Removed legends money printing skills like lumber etc.

# Ouput - create channels for money to flow out

//Event rework
- Disabled some events I experienced every playthrough and thought didn't add much.
- Reworked MOST event bros to be of higher quality to fix the problem of accepting them and then kicking them from party. Made changes where it made sense.
- Made certain events garunteed to happen within the timeframe ie. kingsguard recovering.
- Reworked some events to be repeatable and provide benefits to certain backgrounds. Ie. apprentice learns event can trigger max twice for 1 apprentice. And the event cooldown is a week.
