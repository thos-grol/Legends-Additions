Economy Overhaul

patch:
- escort_caravan_contract.nut
- world_state.nut

//TODO: investigate and fix cause for price varience
//TODO: integrate logic World economy

Caravans now take goods out of each building's inventory of the town they leave, carry the goods in their inventory, and deliver the goods into the inventory of the town they arrive at. Paying the origin town when they unload.
Patrols, Mercenaries, Ships, Peasants and caravans are more frequent to increase the odds of caravans making it through and towns serving and thriving.

//FEATURE_5: Faction Overhaul
    //every settlement spawns guards, guards vary in strength
    //update action
        faction action <- factions have a chance to build strength during update
            combine multiple contract checks into update action,
            contract expiring can raise bandit faction strength
            contract completion can raise settlement strength/security
            settlements store monster strength, create witcher necrophages?

    //military action <- suppress menace

    //function buildSettlements( _rect )

    //Predefine noble house
        //function createNobleHouses( _num )
        //function assignSettlementsToNobleHouses( _nobleHouses )
            //upon assigning settlement to noble house, you can edit the buildings and attached locations?

    //Building camps only occur when faction strength reaches threshold to expand
    //Factions with no camps remain dormant until later
    //Contracts are only generated when faction strength reaches a certain ammount

======== BUILDS ===========

General 1h builds (all 1h weps) =
-straight boring duelist
-dueling duelist: with parry dagger
-utility duelist: with offhand training (usually a 1h mace) and stacked with nets
-1h axe headshot build: (uses heft to go for 'domes')
-1h 3-head flail with feint and fast adaptation (this one is a beaut! I'm known for my love of flails and 3-head and reach flails are king!)
-1h spear dodge overwhelm: best 1v1 'duelist' in the game (doesn't use duelist perk though, practically unbeatable in 1v1, 4 stacks of overwhelm at super high speeds)

General 2h builds (most 2h weps are ok with these)
-generic 2h'er: main 2h wep
-2h sword MoB: fatigue neutral build that lets you AOE every turn... one of my most disgusting and reliable builds
-2h 'round spin': probably MoB so you can spin in a circle every turn with a 2h axe/flail (only ever did this build on a lone wolf, not a common/workable build with allies around lol and the fatigue is expensive without mob)

Reach weapons:
-2h flail reach: 2 types of builds, MoB and generic (disgusting infinite headshot build, can just use rebound for basic, but headhunter with MoB is very strong)
-general polearm/reach weapon: followup with recover, keeps people pretty strong in your backline
-2h reach cleav: big numbers with mauler ðŸ™‚ (also super scary with follow-up)
-support mace: (with MoB you can make a support reach mace that can stun every turn, they're very nice indeed, maybe even polearm mastery so they can move 2 spaces every turn before stunning)

Ranged builds:
-obv. throwing deleter: throwing with muscularity (i forgot, muscularity in multi-attacks-per-turn-builds are a strong help) javelins delete people, 2-shotting footmen is fun!
-slinger headshot build: yeah, it's definitely fun lol (push the advantange feeds back on a slinger's successful headshot for more headshots)
-perfect focus archer: crazy first turn, recover next turn, rinse repeat and you'll knock out multiple kills in your 'attacking' turns)
-over/fear/feint/gunner: the gunner that does everything (usually don't have enough perks to make it) but feint, and fearsome are a great way to make gunners 'fun' ðŸ˜›

Tanks:
-dodge nimble: generic speedy tank, hates nets and staggers and nomads.... super tricky but super rewarding if you don't have enemy stagger sand such (hates goblins & nomads)
-medium bonus stats: saves your weaker tanks from dying with good balance (or just in general a good tank, still doesn't like staggers, but more forgiving imo)
-generic BF wall: heaviest armour, 'nimble attachment' (a.k.a fur padding) makes the best tank imo, can take big hits and cbow/armour pierce isn't as bad
ALSO
different ways to fluff up your tank.
-rebound for infinite shieldwalls
-or, tower shield to get best def without needing a shieldwall (can't really ever get MoB tanks imo, too many stats and getting fortify every turn is too hard [usually the same with indomitable sadly])

Banner/support builds:
-holy magic bros: monks and such with MoB. resolve and fatigue to support with heals, free def (and if banner is added, you can use inspiring presence)
-rally banner: can be used with ^holy magic^, just need to have high res as usual and MoB
-musician: drumming/singing perks, maybe even have 'entice'/'revolt' (the ranged shield bash is a very nice support ability imo)
-I've combined a holy magic support and a tank before on one of my stream/YT playthroughs iirc (was a fun combo lol, did decently)
-ohh and with all supports/banners, inspire is great ofc.
